# Google Gemini Notes

These are some examples from my Jan 16 2024 presentation at the Flux Linux User Group.

Examples are from the Google quickstart guide with some minor output additions. 
See (https://ai.google.dev/tutorials/web_quickstart) for more information.

These should all build with the following (using the ```chat``` module as an example):
```
cd chat
go mod init digitalhermit.com/gemini/chat
go mod tidy
go build .
```
